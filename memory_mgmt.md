## Memory area allocated by JVM


The major concepts in Java Memory Management :

* Loading Metadata
* JVM Memory Structure
* Working of Garbage Collector




* **Class(Method) Area** : Stores class metadata, static variables, and code for methods and constructors.
* **Heap** : Stores objects, arrays and other data structure.
* **Stack** : Stores method call frames, local variables, and primitive data types.
* **Program Counter Register** :  Stores the address of the next instruction to be executed for each thread.
* **Native Method Stack** : Stores native method calls (if any).
