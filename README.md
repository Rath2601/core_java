# **CORE JAVA NOTES**

## **SYNTAX**:

### Class Definition

```java
{public/default} {abstract/final --if needed} class/interface {class_name} {....... }

abstract/final --> not needed for interface

```

### Variable Definition

```java
{public/default/protected/private} {transient - if needed} {volatile/final --if needed} {static --if needed} {datatype} {variable_name} = {value} ;

transient --> marking a variable as transient indicates that it should not be serialized.
             serialization --> persistence, networking, distributed systems, caching, JMS & message brokers.
volatile  --> to indicate that a variable's value will be modified by different threads. (change in one thread is visible to all threads)

```
### Method Definition

```java
{public/default/protected/private} {abstract/final --if needed} {static --if needed} {synchronized -- if needed} {return type --> void & others} {method_name} (parameters ...any number) { ... }

synchronized keyword --> used in Static method, Instance method, and a code block inside Instance method.
synchronized(this) { } --> locks on the current instance of the class.
```

## **DATATYPE**:

1. **How bit-level datatype consumes memory.**

2. **Byte has a range of** `2^7 - 1` **to** `-2^7`. 
   - If exceeded, we have to cast explicitly, which may lead to overflow/underflow.

3. **Other data types have their range based on the memory they consume.**
   - `char` has a range of `0` to `65535`.

4. **Data type conversions:**
   - `byte` → `short` → `int` ← `long` (with casting)
   - `int` → `float` → `double`
   - `long` → `float` → `double`
   - to convert long, float and double as int , need explicit casting.
   - to convert float and double as long , need explicit casting.
   - to convert double as float , need explicit casting.

5. **By default:**
   - Whole numbers are treated as `int`.
   - Decimal numbers are treated as `double`.

6. **Use** `f/F`, `d/D`, `l/L` **for proper identification of float, double, and long respectively.**

7. **If the value is out of range, it will roll over to the negative range (like rotation).**

8. **We can use large numbers like** `2_147_483_647`.

## **EXECUTION ORDER** :

**static block** --> **main method** --> **non-static block** (executed at every object creation)--> **non-static method** / **static method** (based on calling order).

**static block** --> initialize static variables or perform one-time actions when the class is loaded

**non -static block** --> called everytime when a new object created.

## **VARIABLE TYPES**:

### **1.Instance Variable**:
     different for each object.
     initialization not mandatory.(default value applied)
     created along with its object and destroyed along with its object.
### **2.Static variable**:
     only difference is static keyword & this is common for all object.
     if changed through one object it'll be reflected in all objects.
### **3.Local/ method variable**:
     initialization is mandatory.
     local to method/constructor/block. cant be accessed outside unless passed/ returned from a method.
     only default AM / final permitted.

if we need to call **NON-STATIC** in  **STATIC** method we need object.

## **AM**:

1. **public** --> visible to all classes.
2. **default** --> visible to classes under same package.
3. **protected** --> visible to only inherited classes.
4. **private** --> visible to only that class.

* Nested class can have any access modifier.

## **IMPORTANT KEYWORDS STATIC / FINAL / SUPER / THIS**:

### **STATIC : ( class, method , variable , block )**

1. static can be used in nested class (class inside class)
2. If we use static it belongs to the class.
3. We can't use static/final keyword with constructor.
   * Constructors are meant to initialize new objects. Hence static can't be used.
   * constructors cannot be inherited in Java therefore, there is no need to write final before constructors.
5. we can't override static/final/private method.
6. static can be used in object creation in case of singleton pattern.(static Obj j = new Obj(); )

### **FINAL : (class , method , variable)**

1. final class can't be inherited.
2. final method can't be overridden
3. final variable can't be changed. variable cannot be modified after it has been initialized. (IMMUTABLE)
4. final variable can't have setter method.
5. final doesn't support block.

* final var --> Used for constants that are specific to "each object instance" and remain unchanged after initialization.
              (can be initialized for each object using a constructor. that's why this differs from static final)
* static final var --> Used for constants that are associated with the class itself and are shared across "all instances".

### **SUPER : (INHERITANCE)**

1. can't use super in static content/methods.
2. constructor call must be the first statement in constructor. (using super)
   (only one constructor can be called from a constructor)

4. can be used to call **variable** of parent class (super.parentClassVariable .. both static & non-static) (but static should be accessed only with class name)
5. can be used to call **method** of parent class (super.parentClassMethod .. both static & non-static) (but static should be accessed only with class name)
    (If parent's method not implemented in child class no need to use super)
6. Can call parent's constructor with its param.(can be called **only** from child constructor)

### **THIS : (ENCAPSULATION)**

1. to refer instance(non-static) variable in current class. (but static should be accessed only with class name)
2. this(....params) to call current class matching constructor.
3. this can be used to refer "current class Instance". (use -> method chaining)
4. the previous one can be passed as argument to another method which have (Class objName) as Parameter.
5. this can be used to call current class non static method with matching params.
6. constructor call must be the first statement in constructor. (using this)
7. **cant use with static content**.

## **INHERITANCE: (encourages polymorphism)**

* All classes by default extends Object class.
* types --> single, multilevel, hierarchical.
* 1 Java doesn't support multiple inheritance (DIAMOND PROBLEM) . solved with interface.
* In case of Interface method as private, static, default we can't override it.
* In normal classes , private/static cant be overrided. other methods can have equal or greater visibility.
  
   1. **protected** --> protected,  public.
   2. **default** --> default, protected, public.
   3. **public** --> public.

* child class object can access all methods from parent class.
* If A a = new C(); , In this, instance of C is created and with this we can access all methods of the classes (A, B, C)
  [**but if the method is overriden in all the classes , then the last overriden method only can be called. To call precisely need to create object specifically.**]
* If Instance created for A only its method can be accessed. If instance created for B methods of A & B can be accessed.
* IF we create B b =(B) new A(); JVM will throw ClassCastException. B is a subset of A. so it will think B can't be initialized with A object.  
* A final class can't be made parent class.

### **CONSTRUCTOR**:

* Objective to initialize the value.
* name as class and should not have a return type.
* first line of constructor must be either super() or this();
* If we have explicit constructor with param in parent class, we need to use super with req params.
* default super() will be supplied to constructor.


## **POLYMORPHISM**:

* Types : compile-time polymorphism (overloading) | runtime polymorphism (overriding)
* overloading --> same method name & different parameters
* overriding --> class must be inherited, same method signature.
* final/static/private method cant be overrided.
* methods can have equal or greater visibility.

## **ENCAPSULATION**:

* Encapsulation is the mechanism of restricting access to certain components of an object and only exposing a controlled interface to the outside world.

### Benefits of Encapsulation

* **Data Hiding**: Only necessary information is exposed, while the implementation details remain hidden.This reduces the complexity of the code.
* **Security**: Protects an object’s state by controlling the access and modification of its fields.
* **Flexibility and Maintainability**: Changes to the encapsulated code can be made independently without affecting other parts of the program.
* **Improved Code Reusability**: Encapsulated code can be reused more easily as it is modular and self-contained.

### How to Achieve Encapsulation in Java

* **Private Fields**: Declare the class fields (variables) as private to restrict direct access from outside the class.

* **Public Methods**: Provide public getter and setter methods to allow controlled access and modification of the fields.


## **ABSTRACTION**:

### **ABSTRACT CLASS**:

* can't create object. To create object must be inherited. (interface dont have constructor)
* can have both abstract method and concrete method.
* static & final keyword never comes with abstract method.
* abstract methods must be declared not defined.
* abstract methods must be overriden. 
* variable can't be abstract. (since the syntax abstract itself doesn't apply for variable)
* can have static and non static block.

### **INTERFACE**:

* Can't have an object. To create object must be inherited. (interface dont have constructor)
* default methods only allowed in interfaces. If it is overridden , it's AM should be public.
* we can use private / static / default method to implement some logic in interface itself.
  * Default Methods: [**can be accessed with child object if not overrided**] [**else this can be accessed using interface.super.methodName**]
    * Backward Compatibility: Allow new methods to be added to interfaces without requiring existing implementing classes to override them, preventing code breakage.
    * Code Reusability: Provide common functionality directly in the interface, reducing code duplication across implementing classes.
  * Static Methods: [**can be accessed with class name**]
    * Utility Methods: Enable utility functions related to the interface, accessible without creating an instance of an implementing class, keeping relevant methods together.
  * Private Methods:
    Hold all the logic that can be used only by default/static methods inside interface.

* all methods are public abstract.
* all variables are public static final.
* can't have static and non static block.

## **INNER CLASSES**:

*uses of inner class*:
1. A member inner class is a class defined within another class and behaves like a member of the outer class. (OuterClass.InnerClass ic =o.new InnerClass();)
2. A member class can be static also. (OuterClass.InnerClass ic =new OuterClass.InnerClass();)
3. class created inside method, can be accessed only within the method.
4. anonymous inner class used when you need a one-off implementation. 
(i.e interface anonymous inner class instantiated | that particular object reference used to call that method alone) 
5. For the above all unimplemented methods will be used for a single object creation using anonymous inner class.
---

## **INBUILD CLASSES** : 

* By default java.lang package will be imported (implicitly)
* STATIC import can be made only for a particular class.
* Other packages we're importing it to use them in your code without needing to specify their full package.
* classes like Math, String, StringBuffer, StringBuilder, all wrapper classes, Arrays and etc.
---
### **OBJECT CLASS**:

#### **equals(Object obj)**:

* Default: Checks reference equality (whether two references point to the same object).
* Purpose: Override to define logical equality based on object content.
* Common usage: Necessary for comparing objects logically, especially in collections.

#### **hashCode()**:

* Default: Returns a unique integer for each object instance.
* Purpose: Override when equals is overridden to ensure objects that are equal have the same hash code.
* Common usage: Used in hash-based collections (like HashMap, HashSet) to group objects.

#### **toString()**:

* Default: Returns a string with the class name + "@" + hash code in hexadecimal.
* Purpose: Override to provide a readable, custom representation of an object’s content.
* Common usage: Useful for debugging and logging.

---
### **STRING MANIPULATION**:

| Type           | Mutability | Thread Safety   | Performance |
|----------------|------------|-----------------|-------------|
| String         | Immutable  | Not synchronized | Faster      |
| StringBuilder  | Mutable    | Not synchronized | Faster      |
| StringBuffer   | Mutable    | Synchronized     | Slower      |

* String has two main concepts. **Immutability and String pool**
* **Immutability** -->  Once a String object is created, its value cannot be changed.
  ( Each modification (like concatenation, substring extraction, etc.) results in the creation of a new String object rather than modifying the existing one.)
* **String pool** --> The String pool is a special memory area in the Java heap where String literals are stored.
  (Purpose: It allows Java to reuse String literals to save memory.)


---
### **MULTITHREADING**:

* To create a thread we can use,extend the Thread class and override the run() method.
* Implement the Runnable interface and pass the instance of the class to a Thread object.
* **start()** : Creates a new thread and runs concurrently.
* **run()**   : Calling run method, runs in the main thread, not concurrently.
* **sleep()** : Pauses the thread for a specified time Useful to delay execution or simulate time-based tasks.
* **join()**  : Waits for this thread to terminate. (only work on running thread / otherwise just moves to next line)
* **yield()** : Hints to the thread scheduler that the current thread is willing to yield its current use of CPU to let other threads execute. (but totally dependent upon OS)
* **interrupt()**: Signals that the thread should stop its current operation.

---
### **WRAPPER CLASSES** : 

1. Wrapper classes -> Byte, Short, Integer, Long, Float, Double, Character, Boolean. (wraps its respective primitive type)
2. Once an object is created, its value cannot be changed. **(immutable)**.  [AtomicInteger, AtomicLong are mutable, suitable for multithreading]
3. Also these classes are also final and can't be subclassed.
4. wrapper classes cache frequently used values to improve performance. [Integer.valueOf(100) will return same object reference]
5. **Conversion Utilities** to convert between datatypes.
6. Wrapper classes **can have null values**, when we use Optional values, Database Interaction, working with Collections.
7. All wrapper classes are **SERIALIZABLE BY DEFAULT**

**USES** :
1. Thread safe
2. Immutable object created
3. has conversion utilities (one datatype to another)
4. working with collection objects (as this can have null values)
---
### **ENUM**:

1. Constants defined this way make the code more readable,
  allow for compile-time checking, 
  document the list of accepted values upfront, 
  and avoid unexpected behavior due to invalid values being passed in.
2. Can only implements interface & its method should be overridden by each ENUM CONSTANTS, Can't extends any class
3. Enum can be used in switch statements
4. Enum should initialize values using constructor and have getter method to retrieve specific field from the enum. (i.e Season.SPRING.getDesc();)
5. enums are implicitly constants, and are seperated by "," and end with ";" and declared only in capitals

**USES**:
* define fixed set of constants
* Improve code readability work well with switch
* ensure type safety
  
---
### **EXCEPTION HANDLING** :

1. **try-catch-finally Structure**:
   - A `try` block must be followed by a `catch` block or a `finally` block.
   - A `catch` block must be paired with a `try` block.
   - `try` and `catch` can exist without a `finally` block.
   - The `finally` block is used to execute cleanup actions, such as closing database connections, regardless of whether an exception occurs or not.

2. **Exception Hierarchy**:
   - `Throwable` is the root class in the exception hierarchy, with `Error` and `Exception` as its main subclasses.
   - `Exception` is divided into two types:
     - **Checked exceptions** (compile-time exceptions).
     - **Unchecked exceptions** (runtime exceptions).

3. **Handling Checked Exceptions**:
   - If a checked exception is thrown (either due to inbuilt functionality or via `throw new IOException()`), it must be either:
     - Enclosed in a `try-catch` block, or
     - Declared in the method’s signature using the `throws` keyword to propagate it up the call stack.

4. **Handling Unchecked Exceptions**:
   - Unchecked exceptions do not need to be explicitly caught or declared in the `throws` clause.
   - **Developer’s Choice**: It is up to the developer to decide whether to handle them with a `try-catch` block or use the `throws` keyword.

5. **Multiple Catch Blocks**:
   - Multiple catch blocks can be used to handle different exception types.
   - They should be arranged in **hierarchical order**—the subclass-specific catch block should come before its parent class catch block (e.g., `IOException` before `Exception`).

6. **Exception Hierarchy for Checked Exceptions**:
   - For checked exceptions, this hierarchical order must be strictly followed to avoid compile-time errors (e.g., catching `Exception` before `IOException` is incorrect if both are expected).

7. **Custom Exceptions**:
   - Custom exceptions can be created by extending either `Exception` or `RuntimeException`.
     - Extending `Exception` makes it a **checked exception**.
     - Extending `RuntimeException` makes it an **unchecked exception**.
   - Custom exceptions behave like the exception type they extend (checked or unchecked).

## **JAVA 8 FEATURES** :

## **Lambda Expressions** :

1. Lambda expression can be achieved only with functional interface. (i.e interface with @FuntionalInterface annotation / one abstract method interface)
2. FInterface f = () -> {"logic for that abstract method"};
3. Lambda expression can't be used for default/static method. 
4. The reference from lambda expression logic can be used to call default/static method.

### **IMPORTANT FUNCTIONAL INTERFACE***: Predicate/Function/Consumer/Supplier/BinaryOperator/UnaryOperator/BiConsumer

**Predicate**:

1. boolean-valued function of one argument.
2. methods - test, and, negate, or, isEqual, not (methods in Predicate)

test -> to check the output.
or -> 1st one is true, doesn't check the second one.
and -> check both predicate condition.
negate -> change the obtained value.
isEqual -> similar to .equals method of Object. 
[ predicate will be created Predicate p = Predicate.isEqual(obj1); , then check p.test(obj2); ]
not -> change in the predicate obj itself, not in outcome like negate.

**Function**:

1. function that accepts one argument and produces a result.
2. methods - apply, compose, andThen, identity

apply -> get the output.
compose -> add input( the output of the one function (f2) ) for another function (f1).  f1.compose(f2)
andThen -> add input( the output of the one function (f1) ) for another function (f2).  f1.andThen(f2)
identity ->  function that always returns its input argument.

**Consumer**:

1. accepts a single input argument and returns no result.
2. methods - accept, andThen

accept -> get the output
andThen -> add input( the output of the one function (f1) ) for another function (f2).  f1.andThen(f2)

**Supplier**:

1. a new or distinct result be returned each time the supplier is invoked.
2. has only one method get

**BinaryOperator**:

1. an operation upon two operands of the same type, produce result of same type
2. two methods minBy and maxBy
    minBy -> returns the lesser of two elements according to comparator.
    maxBy -> returns the greater of two elements according to comparator.

**UnaryOperator**:

1. single operand that produces result of same type.
2. one method (identity) -> always returns its input argument.

**BiConsumer**:

1. accepts two input arguments and returns no result.
2. methods -> accept, andThen

#### stream API important methods : filter, map, flatMap, reduce, forEach, collect, distinct, sorted, limit, skip.

**map** ->transforms each element of a stream into another object
**flatMap** -> transforms each element of a stream into zero or more elements

#### **NOTE** : 

1. list(fixed-size) created using Arrays.asList() you cannot add or remove elements from the list. ## UnsupportedOperationException
