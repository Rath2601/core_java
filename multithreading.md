## **Multitasking in a system**
* **Process based** -> multiple threads in multiple process (ex: using paint and word at same time)
* **Thread based** -> multitasking within a program (ex: printing and autocorrecting text at same time)
## **Thread**
* Independent sequential path of execution.
* Many threads can run concurrently.
* At runtime THREADS in a program exist in `common memory` space and share both data & code.
* Lightweight compared to process.
* share the process running the program.
